<p space=



<p align="center"> 

         <p align="left"> <em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once upon a time I was walking through a jungle and I met one of the prettiest and most fittest girl named fitness.
          As soon as I spotted her I fell in love. Ever since that day I married her and as of today we are still together.
          We have made 4 years together and I am very happy about it......... Just Joking... But there is a bit of truth in this story I tell. This short anecdote is the reason why I decided to lose weight and follow a healthy lifestyle.<em></p> 
    

         
         <p align="left"> This short anecdote is the reason why I decided to lose weight and follow a healthy lifestyle. </p>

        <p align="left"> But there is more to the story and here it is: </p>
            <p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All my life I have been fat and my weight to me really never mattered to me until summer of 2011. Before then I never really considered how fat and unhealthy I was. I did not care about losing weight because I thought it was stupid. I always thought that I was too young to worry about being fat and having to lose weight. Since I was younger my family members would always call me fat and talk about how I needed to lose weight or soon I was only going to burst.When these jokes were being made I really did not mind because I took it as a joke, (so it basically went through one air and out the other.</p>

            <p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first I did not store such negative comments in my head because I knew how damaging it would be on a young mind like mine. But because these very close family members of mind said it all the damn time It started to grow into my head. And every time a comment about how everything I was eating was going to kill me and that I needed to stop eating all together started to bother me more and more .</p>

            <p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All these negative comments that I tried so hard to disregard just kept on building up in my system and after awhile I really started to believe I was fat. So what I started to do was wear big clothes to hid my fatness, which in turn I hid who I truly was. I tried not to eat for a couple of hours but as a fat-ass *(Excuse me) I really loved food too goddam much. </p>

            <p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since I can remember, food has always made me feel better and it was just soo comforting to give up. So I gave up on trying to starve and did not care about my weightSo I sort of started binge eating. This comfort that I found in food became my shield from all the hurt I was going though.But binge eating, especially as a child is extremely dangerous and by doing that I became fatter and unhealthier.When I went to the doctor, they continuously told my mother how overweight I was and at the rate I was going I was soon going to end up with diabetes and heart problems. </p>

            <p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But since I was young the idea of losing weight never occurred to me. It was not until I started high-school that I figured I had to change my life.A close friend of mine and I had planned on working out together but there would always be an excuse as to why we could not start as soon as possible. Soon enough though I got tired of waiting and went ahead and signed up for planet fitness which was pretty cheap and amazing.</p>

            <p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I started working out at the gym it was very difficult because I did not know where to start. Not only did I not know what to do, but I had very low endurance when working out. So I started by running for 15 seconds straight and then taking a break and then running another 30 seconds straight and soon I was doing 2 minutes straight. From this I continuously built my endurance to running up to 45 minutes straight. It was a struggle but it was worth it. </p> 


            <p align="left"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the biggest reasons why I would say I continued was because I feel in love with working out.<br> I feel in love with the high I got from sprinting on the treadmill. I fell in love with those few seconds I could not breath from running so fast, because in that moment I could not think about anything‚Äì in that moment all worries and thoughts went out the window and all I could worry about was getting air into my lungs. ( I know it sounds weird, but its the truth). At such a young age I had too much going on, so working out was my new outlet.</p> 



<p align="center"> So yeah this is my story.
