				<h2> <strong>Our History.</strong></h2>
				<p>
					â€œAll too often, we are forced to pick one medical career and follow through with it. However, at such a young age we fail to acknowledge the many professions that make up the field of medicine. With so little knowledge and experience, we begin to readily sign ourselves up for the one career we are most familiar with, <strong> a medical physician </strong>. Then follows the feeling of obligation, accompanied with daily stress to configure out our career paths and the way in which we will get there. With little to no guidance and lack of information, many students become lost or give up on their dream to pursue the field of medicine all together. Little do we know that we are not confined to just one career path, when there are so many out there! With these thoughts in mind, TBSOM has been created to allow any and every one to explore the many medical fields out there in the world.
